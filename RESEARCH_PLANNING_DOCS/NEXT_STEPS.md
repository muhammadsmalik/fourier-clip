Comprehensive Next Steps Plan: FADA-CLIP Implementation

Based on my review of your documentation, here’s the synthesized plan for implementing Frequency-Aware Dual-Stream Adaptation (FADA) for CLIP on the Office-Home dataset:

⸻

Phase 1: Environment Setup & Baseline (Days 1–3)
	1.	Set up development environment
	•	Create conda environment with PyTorch, transformers, CLIP
	•	Install Office-Home dataset tools
	•	Set up evaluation pipeline with leave-one-domain-out protocol
	2.	Establish CLIP baseline
	•	Implement Office-Home dataloader with 65 classes
	•	Verify CLIP ViT-B/16 zero-shot baseline (~82.4% accuracy)
	•	Test on all 4 domains (Art, Clipart, Product, Real-World)
	3.	Fetch critical resources
	•	FDA GitHub implementation (frequency transform code)
	•	CLIP-Adapter source code (adapter integration patterns)
	•	Additional frequency decomposition references

⸻

Phase 2: Core Frequency Decomposition Module (Days 4–7)
	1.	Implement FrequencyDecomposer module
	•	Based on FDA’s low_freq_mutate_np function
	•	2D FFT decomposition with configurable threshold (β=0.1–0.15)
	•	Separate high/low frequency components
	2.	Integrate with CLIP features
	•	Test insertion points: after layer 6 (middle) vs layer 11 (final)
	•	Handle CLIP’s token format (reshape for 2D FFT)
	•	Preserve CLS token for classification
	3.	Build DualStreamCLIP architecture
	•	Parallel processing of frequency streams
	•	Maintain CLIP’s frozen backbone
	•	Add frequency-specific processing heads

⸻

Phase 3: Adapter Design & Integration (Days 8–11)
	1.	Implement frequency-specific adapters
	•	Low-frequency adapter (~0.1M params, LoRA-style)
	•	High-frequency adapter (~0.5M params, bottleneck design)
	•	Use CLIP-Adapter’s residual connection pattern
	2.	Design fusion mechanism
	•	Implement FFDI’s Information Interaction Mechanism
	•	Spatial attention masks from low-frequency features
	•	Weighted combination with learnable parameters
	3.	Add training components
	•	Frequency consistency loss (preserve semantics)
	•	Contrastive loss between streams
	•	Classification loss with auxiliary heads

⸻

Phase 4: Training & Optimization (Days 12–15)
	1.	Implement training pipeline
	•	FDAG augmentation (frequency domain noise)
	•	SWAD for flat minima optimization
	•	Progressive frequency threshold adjustment
	2.	Hyperparameter tuning
	•	Learning rates for different components
	•	Loss weight balancing (λ parameter)
	•	Adapter scaling factors
	3.	Run initial experiments
	•	Train on 3 domains, test on 1 (all combinations)
	•	Monitor per-domain performance
	•	Track Art/Clipart improvements specifically

⸻

Phase 5: Ablation Studies & Refinement (Days 16–18)
	1.	Component ablations
	•	Single vs dual stream
	•	With/without frequency augmentation
	•	Different fusion strategies
	•	Frequency threshold sensitivity
	2.	Integration with SOTA methods
	•	Combine with attention head purification (if time permits)
	•	Test with different CLIP backbones (ViT-L/14)
	•	Ensemble strategies
	3.	Final evaluation
	•	Complete Office-Home results
	•	Comparison with baselines
	•	Performance analysis per domain

⸻

Key Implementation Decisions
	•	Architecture choices
	•	Use ViT-B/16 as primary backbone (balance of performance/efficiency)
	•	Insert frequency decomposition after layer 6 (middle of transformer)
	•	LoRA-style adapters for parameter efficiency
	•	Training strategy
	•	Batch size: 32–64 depending on GPU memory
	•	Learning rate: 1e-4 for adapters, 1e-5 for fusion
	•	Train for 50 epochs with early stopping
	•	Use cosine annealing scheduler
	•	Evaluation protocol
	•	Leave-one-domain-out cross-validation
	•	Report average accuracy and per-domain breakdown
	•	Focus on Art/Clipart improvements as key metrics

⸻

Success Metrics
	•	Minimum target: 85% average accuracy (>2.5% over CLIP baseline)
	•	Realistic target: 87% average accuracy (matching current SOTA)
	•	Stretch goal: 88–89% with full optimizations

⸻

Risk Mitigation

If frequency decomposition doesn’t improve CLIP:
	1.	Try wavelet transform instead of FFT
	2.	Apply to attention maps rather than features
	3.	Use multi-scale frequency decomposition

⸻

This plan leverages the FDA implementation for core FFT operations, CLIP-Adapter patterns for integration, and FFDI’s fusion mechanism for combining streams, creating a novel approach specifically targeting Office-Home’s style–content challenges.
