INITIAL PLAN:

Phase 2: FrequencyDecomposer Module Implementation Plan

Architecture Overview & Justification

Key Design Decision: Where to Apply Frequency Decomposition
	‚Ä¢	Intercept features before the final projection layer but after spatial tokens are available.
	‚Ä¢	Rationale:
	1.	CLIP ViT-B/16 outputs
	‚Ä¢	Final output: pooled features [batch, 512]
	‚Ä¢	Internal tokens: [batch, 197, 768] (196 patches + 1 CLS token)
	2.	FFT requires 2D structure
	‚Ä¢	Reshape patch tokens into a 14√ó14 grid
	‚Ä¢	Perform frequency decomposition on this spatial map

‚∏ª

Implementation Components

1. FrequencyDecomposer Class

class FrequencyDecomposer(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, threshold=0.1):
        # threshold = L parameter from FDA (0.1 = 10% of frequencies are low)

	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	Modular, testable component
	‚Ä¢	Threshold as parameter ‚Üí easy ablations
	‚Ä¢	Follows PyTorch best practices

‚∏ª

2. FFT Operations (Modern PyTorch API)

Old FDA code (deprecated):

fft_src = torch.rfft(src_img, signal_ndim=2, onesided=False)

Modern PyTorch (>=1.7):

fft_src = torch.fft.fft2(src_img)   # complex tensor
amp = torch.abs(fft_src)            # amplitude
phase = torch.angle(fft_src)        # phase

	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	torch.fft.fft2 is the current standard
	‚Ä¢	Returns proper complex tensors
	‚Ä¢	Cleaner, NumPy/SciPy-compatible API

‚∏ª

3. Frequency Separation Strategy

def create_frequency_mask(H, W, threshold):
    # Low frequencies appear at corners
    # fftshift moves them to center
    # Apply square mask of size threshold * min(H, W)

	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	Follows FDA/FFDI pattern
	‚Ä¢	Scale-invariant (percentage-based threshold)
	‚Ä¢	Square mask = standard in frequency domain

‚∏ª

4. Feature Extraction & Reshaping

# Extract features before projection
visual_features = clip_model.visual.transformer(x)     # [B, 197, 768]
patch_features = visual_features[:, 1:, :]             # [B, 196, 768] (exclude CLS)
spatial_features = patch_features.reshape(B, 14, 14, 768)
spatial_features = spatial_features.permute(0, 3, 1, 2) # [B, 768, 14, 14]

	‚Ä¢	Why:
	‚Ä¢	FFT requires spatial grids
	‚Ä¢	14√ó14 from (224 √∑ 16)
	‚Ä¢	Channels-first ‚Üí CNN convention

‚∏ª

Testing Strategy

Test 1: FFT Invertibility

def test_fft_invertibility():
    x = torch.randn(2, 768, 14, 14)
    decomposer = FrequencyDecomposer()
    low, high = decomposer(x)
    reconstructed = low + high
    assert torch.allclose(x, reconstructed, atol=1e-5)

	‚Ä¢	Verifies no information loss

Test 2: Frequency Threshold Effect
	‚Ä¢	Check that varying threshold changes the low/high split

Test 3: Standalone Module Test
	‚Ä¢	Use synthetic data
	‚Ä¢	Visualize low vs high frequencies ‚Üí smooth vs detailed patterns

‚∏ª

Integration Points
	1.	FADA_CLIP.__init__()
	‚Ä¢	Add self.freq_decomposer = FrequencyDecomposer(hparams['frequency_threshold'])
	2.	FADA_CLIP.predict()
	‚Ä¢	Extract spatial features
	‚Ä¢	Apply decomposition
	‚Ä¢	For Phase 2: validate shapes, still return original predictions

‚∏ª

Risk Mitigation
	1.	Fallback flag ‚Üí bypass decomposition if needed
	2.	Gradient flow ‚Üí use only differentiable PyTorch ops
	3.	Memory ‚Üí batch-wise processing
	4.	Numerical stability ‚Üí add epsilon to divisions

‚∏ª

Why This Approach is Robust
	1.	Pure PyTorch native ops (no custom FFT)
	2.	Based on proven FDA design
	3.	Testable in isolation
	4.	Incremental: doesn‚Äôt break CLIP zero-shot
	5.	Configurable via hparams

‚∏ª

Expected Outputs
	‚Ä¢	low_freq_features: [B, 768, 14, 14] ‚Üí smooth, content-focused
	‚Ä¢	high_freq_features: [B, 768, 14, 14] ‚Üí detailed, texture-focused
	‚Ä¢	Validation: low + high ‚âà original (within precision)

‚∏ª

Next Steps After Phase 2
	‚Ä¢	Phase 3: Add adapters for separate processing of low/high streams
	‚Ä¢	Phase 4: Add fusion mechanism

Core Challenge & Solution

Problem
	‚Ä¢	CLIP's VisionTransformer outputs a single 512-dim vector after projection (model.py, lines 235‚Äì238).
	‚Ä¢	For FFT-based decomposition, we require spatial features with 2D structure, not just the final pooled vector.
	‚Ä¢	Need to balance minimal implementation with spatial access requirements.

Solution Analysis & Final Choice
After evaluating 6 different approaches:

1. ‚ùå Reimplement CLIP forward pass (Score: 3/10) - Violates "no reimplementation" principle
2. ‚ùå Use final 1D features (Score: 4/10) - No real spatial structure for 2D FFT
3. ‚úÖ Hook on transformer output (Score: 7/10) - Good but requires reshaping
4. üèÜ Hook on Conv1 output (Score: 8/10) - OPTIMAL: Already spatial [B, 768, 14, 14]
5. ‚ùå Hook on ln_post (Score: 5/10) - Already pooled, no spatial info
6. ‚úÖ Custom wrapper module (Score: 7.5/10) - Clean but adds complexity

**CHOSEN SOLUTION: Option 4 - Forward Hook on Conv1 Output**

Justification:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Already in perfect spatial format [B, 768, 14, 14] for 2D FFT
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Minimal code changes (3-4 lines)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ No reshaping or complex transformations needed
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Uses PyTorch's official hook API (no custom implementations)
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Follows CLIP-Adapter philosophy of minimal modifications
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Clean fallback: can disable hook if issues arise

Implementation Architecture

1. Spatial Feature Extraction via Forward Hook

def setup_spatial_hook(clip_model):
    """Setup forward hook to capture Conv1 spatial features."""
    spatial_features = None
    
    def hook_fn(module, input, output):
        nonlocal spatial_features
        spatial_features = output  # [B, 768, 14, 14] - perfect for FFT!
    
    # Register hook on Conv1 - earliest spatial representation
    handle = clip_model.visual.conv1.register_forward_hook(hook_fn)
    
    return handle, lambda: spatial_features

Key Advantages of Conv1 Hook:
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Output is already [B, 768, 14, 14] - perfect spatial structure for 2D FFT
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ No reshaping, no complex tensor manipulations
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Captures raw spatial patterns before transformer mixing
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Early in pipeline - preserves spatial locality
	‚Ä¢	‚úÖ Minimal code - just 3 lines for hook setup

Why Conv1 vs Other Layers:
	‚Ä¢	conv1: [B, 768, 14, 14] ‚úÖ Perfect for FFT
	‚Ä¢	transformer: [B, 197, 768] ‚ùå Needs complex reshaping  
	‚Ä¢	ln_post: [B, 768] ‚ùå Already pooled, no spatial info
	‚Ä¢	Final output: [B, 512] ‚ùå No spatial structure

2. FrequencyDecomposer Module

        self.threshold = threshold

    def forward(self, x):
        """
        Args:
            x: Spatial features [B, C, H, W]
        Returns:
            low_freq: Low-frequency features [B, C, H, W]
            high_freq: High-frequency features [B, C, H, W]
        """
        # FFT

        # Frequency mask
        B, C, H, W = x.shape

        center_h, center_w = H // 2, W // 2

        h1, h2 = center_h - mask_size // 2, center_h + mask_size // 2 + 1
        w1, w2 = center_w - mask_size // 2, center_w + mask_size // 2 + 1

        mask[h1:h2, w1:w2] = 1.0
        return mask

Design Justifications
	1.	torch.fft.fft2 with norm='ortho' ‚Äì modern, stable, energy-preserving.
	2.	fftshift/ifftshift ‚Äì centers low frequencies for intuitive masking.
	3.	Square centered mask ‚Äì efficient, scale-invariant with threshold.
	4.	Taking .real ‚Äì input is real; discards numerical noise in imaginary part.

3. Integration into FADA_CLIP

class FADA_CLIP(CLIPZeroShot):
    def __init__(self, input_shape, num_classes, num_domains, hparams):
        super().__init__(input_shape, num_classes, num_domains, hparams)

        if self.spatial_features is not None:
            # Apply frequency decomposition
            low_freq, high_freq = self.freq_decomposer(self.spatial_features)

        """Clean up hook when object is destroyed."""
        if hasattr(self, 'hook_handle'):

Test 5: End-to-End Integration Test

def test_fada_clip_integration():
