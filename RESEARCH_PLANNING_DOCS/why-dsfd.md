Winner: Dual-Stream Frequency Decomposition (DSFD)
Why DSFD is the most promising:

Strong Theoretical Foundation: Frequency decomposition is well-established in signal processing with clear mathematical foundations. The separation of style (high-frequency) from content (low-frequency) directly addresses Office-Home's core challenge.
Perfect Feasibility: Can be implemented with existing tools (FFT, wavelets) and integrated with CLIP without extensive modifications. Clear ablation path: test frequency separation alone, then add specialized adapters.
High Performance Potential: Addresses the specific Art/Clipart weakness of current methods by explicitly handling style variations. Could push beyond 87% by better preserving semantic content while adapting style.
Computational Efficiency: Frequency transforms are fast, and the dual-stream can share early CLIP layers. Can use lightweight adapters (LoRA-style) for each stream.
Novel Contribution: While frequency analysis exists in vision, applying it specifically to domain generalization with dual-stream adaptation in CLIP is unexplored. Clear conference paper potential.

Key Advantages over Current SOTA:

Addresses root cause: Unlike attention head purification which removes information, DSFD separates and processes it appropriately
Interpretable: Can visualize what each stream learns
Complementary to existing methods: Can be combined with prompting or other adapters
Specific to Office-Home's challenge: Designed for the style vs. content problem that makes Office-Home harder than PACS

The DSFD approach has the ideal balance of novelty, feasibility, and performance potential for an MPhil thesis, with clear implementation steps and evaluation protocols.
